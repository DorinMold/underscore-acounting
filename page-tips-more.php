    <div> When you have bookkeepers and accountants that you know you can trust and rely on, it’s going to make everything simpler. They can teach you how complete your books properly and how to use your accounting software to its full potential. Having a good advisor can become invaluable with the success of your business. </div>
</div>

<div class="tips">
    <div class="col-xs-12"><strong><h4>Set aside time each week to devote to Bookkeeping</h4></strong></div>        
    <div>Keeping your books up to date takes time. Allocate a time each week in your calendar to update your records. Having this time booked in will help to keep things organised and lessens the chance of paperwork being lost. This will also allow you to have a broad overview of your business every week and will ensure you don’t fall behind. Because, trust us – when you fall behind, there’s a good chance you won’t recover. </div>

<div class="tips">
    <div class="col-xs-12"><strong><h4>Set aside money for any taxes</h4></strong></div>
    <div>Keeping on top of your Bookkeeping can help you prepare for you tax bill as you’ll have the information for your Accountant to calculate exactly how much you’ll need to pay later on. Setting aside money every month to pay your end of year tax bill is good practice. This means you won’t have to cut back at the end of the year or get a loan to pay your taxes. You should make sure you talk regularly with your Accountant so there are no surprises.</div>
</div>

<div class="tips">
    <div class="col-xs-12"><strong><h4>Avoid cash where possible</h4></strong></div>
    <div>Using cash makes it hard to keep track of spending. With today’s technology you can make payments electronically from almost anywhere. By using a credit or debit card you can keep track of the amount spent, what it was spent on and where. This makes tracking expenses much easier. </div>
</div>

<div class="tips">
    <div class="col-xs-12"><strong><h4>Keep Personal and Business Finances separate</h4></strong></div>
    <div>It is important to keep your private transactions separate from your business transactions. Mixing the two can get messy and complicated. It’s a lot easier to keep accurate records if you’re only dealing with one type of account. You will save a lot of time keeping these accounts separate.</div>
</div>

<div class="tips">
    <div class="col-xs-12"><strong><h4>Keep track of your expenses</h4></strong></div>
    <div>Expense tracking is a part of Bookkeeping that you can’t treat as low priority. Make sure you keep a log of all your expenses – most accounting software will allow you to do this automatically. When entering these into your software, make sure each item is categorised correctly, i.e. cost of sales, stationery, fuel, internet etc. You can also group your costs into the type of expense, so you can see what each category is costing you, eg employment related, office administration and legal and finance.</div>
</div>

<div class="tips">
    <div class="col-xs-12"><strong><h4>Check in regularly on your accounts recivable</h4></strong></div>
    <div>Having a customer owe you money for goods or services isn’t the same as having that money in your business account. Make sure you stay on top of your accounts receivable by running regular reports, at least monthly, from your accounting software. Without receivables, income dwindles which can cause other issues within your business.
    If you keep your records regularly updated you’ll be able to spend less time on the paperwork side and more time doing what really matters – running your business. If you have any questions about the above or need some help with your Bookkeeping, please contact us here.
